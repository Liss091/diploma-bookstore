                <h2>Welcome to our Bookstore</h2>
                <p>Bookstore gives you an online shopping cart and point-of-sale system for your
                    school's bookstore. Online shoppers can browse and purchase items via the
                    shopping interface or via Buy Now links for individual items embedded on other
                    sites. In-person sales can be handled using Point of Sale, which works with USB
                    barcode scanners and credit card readers. Students who want to pay later can
                    charge their Bookstore orders to their accounts. On the back end, you can manage
                    inventory, process online orders, and run sales reports. Additionally,
                    all Bookstore transactions are automatically fed into your General Ledger.
